# AudioToTextConverter
 Converts an audio clip to text using AssemblyAI's REST API. I followed the tutorial from Coding With John on YouTube and learned a lot about calling an API. You can check out the tutorial video [How To Call a REST API In Java - Converting Speech to Text with AssemblyAI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oq7Y8n1t00). This application utilizes AssemblyAI, and they are credited in the code comments. You can sign up and get your own API key by going to their website [https://AssemblyAI.com/](https://assemblyai.com/)

If you would like to test the code yourself, you *must* have an API key.
